SOLUTION:-

SELECT A.employee_id AS employee_id, A.name AS name,
    COUNT(B.employee_id) AS reports_count,
    ROUND(AVG(B.age), 0) AS average_age
FROM Employees A
LEFT JOIN Employees B ON A.employee_id = B.reports_to
WHERE B.employee_id IS NOT NULL  -- Ensures we only count managers who have direct reports
GROUP BY A.employee_id, A.name
ORDER BY A.employee_id;
